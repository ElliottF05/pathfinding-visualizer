# ðŸ§­ Interactive Pathfinding Visualizer

## Overview
The **Interactive Pathfinding Visualizer** is a web-based tool that allows users to visualize and explore various pathfinding algorithms in real time. Built with **React** and **TypeScript**, this tool demonstrates the step-by-step process of popular search algorithms like **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **A\***. Users can create custom grids, place obstacles, and adjust the speed of the visualizations to see how each algorithm tackles the problem of finding the optimal path.

## Features
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch algorithms like **Dijkstra's** and **A\*** search for the optimal path in real-time.
- **Custom Grids & Obstacles:** Create custom grid layouts and add obstacles to see how algorithms navigate around them.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Modify the speed of the visualization to explore algorithm behavior at your own pace.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Easy-to-use UI to draw obstacles, choose start/end points, and select algorithms for visualization.
  
## Technologies Used
- **React**: Front-end framework for building the interactive user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and scalability in the development process.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the web componenets, styling the application, and enhancing user experience.

## Demo
Check out the live demo of the project:

## How It Works
1. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select either **Dijkstra's Algorithm** or **A\*** from the drop-down menu.
2. **Draw Obstacles**: Click and drag on the grid to draw obstacles that the algorithm will navigate around. Alternatively, choose to randomize the grid.
3. **Set Start and End Points**: Click on the grid to set your starting and ending points.
4. **Visualize**: Hit the "Run" button to see the algorithm in action as it calculates the optimal path.
5. **Adjust Speed**: Use the speed slider to slow down or speed up the visualization process.
