# pathfinding-visualizer

Web app built with React that visualizes pathfinding algorithms

## Specific Todo-List

-   Change control panel handle click to use only one function (instead of a bunch of different ones) with a single argument denoting which type of click it is

## General Todo-List

-   Improve code architecture (interactions between components, shared state, etc)
-   Improve controls (no undefined behavior from user inputs when they shouldn't occur such as during searching)
-   Improve performance
